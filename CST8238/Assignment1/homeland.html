                <h2><b>Government</b></h2>
                <p>Canada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition, with a monarch 
                    and a prime minister who serves as the chair of the Cabinet and head of government. The country is a realm 
                    within the Commonwealth of Nations, a member of the Francophonie and officially bilingual at the federal level. 
                    It ranks among the highest in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, and education. 
                    It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many other countries. Canada's long and complex 
                    relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture.<sup>[1]</sup></p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>The history of Canada covers the period from the arrival of Paleo-Indians thousands of years ago to the present day. 
                    Prior to European colonization, the lands encompassing present-day Canada were inhabited for millennia by Indigenous peoples, 
                    with distinct trade networks, spiritual beliefs, and styles of social organization. Some of these older civilizations had long faded by the time of the first 
                    European arrivals and have been discovered through archaeological investigations.<sup>[2]</sup></p>
